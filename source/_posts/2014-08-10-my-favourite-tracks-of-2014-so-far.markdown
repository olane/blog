Ella Eyre - If I Go
--------------------

{% youtube JJr80jXCepc %}

Ella Eyre caught my attention last year when she collaborated with Rudimental on *Waiting All Night*, but she’s really knocked it out of the park with her debut single, *If I Go*. I simply can’t stop listening to this track. I’ve tried.


Opiuo - Quack Fat
--------------------

{% youtube NAC93Wt3adA %}

Opiuo navigates the depths of the sweatiest wubs and the filthiest saw synths like nobody else. His second album *Meraki* is even fuller of syrupy funk than the first, if that’s possible. It’s brilliant. Here’s my favourite track.


TCTS - Games
--------------------

{% youtube QVJgGmn0bkI %}

I saw TCTS live at last year’s Trinity Hall June Event, and I’ve been intoxicated by his airy take on deep house ever since. In fact, I can pretty much trace my love of the genre back to that gig. This summer’s new single, *Games*, is one part Bondax, one part Disclosure, one part AlunaGeorge, and 100% danceable.


Clean Bandit - Extraordinary feat Sharna Bass
--------------------

{% youtube 40nFOYGVJtY %}

Another artist I was introduced to by the June Event in 2013, Clean Bandit have broken their way into the mainstream this year with a couple of outstanding singles. Marrying feelgood synthpop with classical strings, they’re not to everybody’s taste but they’re certainly to mine.


Pomplamoose - Lorde 2Pac Beck Mashup
--------------------

{% youtube dm3ZEMQf98k %}

I’ve been vaguely aware of Pomplamoose for a little while, but they grabbed my attention a few months back with this fantastic little mashup, with a cool video to boot. Check their youtube channel out, it’s full of great stuff.


Mr. Probz - Waves (Robin Schulz Radio Edit)
--------------------

{% youtube 6MH9qWemtPo %}

My friend Giles introduced me to this track whilst we were preparing for a DJ gig. Hats off to Robin Schulz on this one -- he makes turning a beautiful slow ballad into a catchy pop banger look easy.


Foxes - Let Go for Tonight (High Contrast Remix)
--------------------

{% youtube SwpH4Ya0 %}

I’m a big fan of Foxes. I’m a bigger fan of High Contrast. This one’s had me dancing in my dressing gown more often than I’d like to admit.


NEEDTOBREATHE - State I’m In
--------------------

{% youtube l3Vu29ajrJE %}

A great band cursed with a terrible name. Their newest album, *Rivers In The Wasteland*, doesn’t quite hold up to the soaring, wrenching alt rock that made me fall in love with their 2011 album *The Reckoning*, but this track comes close. What I’d do for that man’s vocal chords doesn’t bear mentioning.


Tchami - Untrue
--------------------

{% youtube DPHsToh4z3Y %}

Did I mention I’m really getting into deep house lately? Tchami delivers another perfectly executed record here -- it’s not as dirty in the bass department as his previous effort *Promesses*, but it more than makes up for that with a funky, airy groove that I can’t help but nod my head to.


Paolo Nutini - Scream (Funk My Life Up)
--------------------

{% youtube fZswz64dFlw %}

It feels like a long time since *Sunny Side Up*, and damn does it feel good to have some more Paolo Nutini to listen to on repeat until I’m sick of it. On first listen I was slightly disappointed, but give it a fourth or fifth listen and I guarantee you’ll be hooked. An album so fine you’ll want to scream hallelujah.
